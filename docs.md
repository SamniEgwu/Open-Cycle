# Waste Management App Documentation
## STEP 1: User Registration and ID Generation
## Registration Process:
When a new user signs up, they provide their basic information (name, email, phone number) to create an account. 

The app generates a unique App ID for each user upon successful registration. This ID is their identifier for all app transactions and activities.

## Purpose of the User ID:
**Identification:** The App ID uniquely identifies users during interactions with collection centers and pickup agents.

**Reward Grams Approval:** The ID ensures that grams earned from returning physical and digital waste are credited to the correct account.

**Tracking:** The ID allows for tracking waste materials throughout the process from collection to delivery at manufacturers or recycling companies.

## Workflow:
**Returning Waste:** Users provide their App ID and digital waste file link when dropping off waste at a collection center or handing it over to a pickup agent.

**Input Collection Center ID:** The user selects the collection center ID when making a waste return request, which the center or agent can accept or reject.

**Grams Allocation:** If the request is approved, grams listed in the digital waste file are credited to the user’s account.

**Tracking and Notifications:** The system tracks the waste lifecycle, sending notifications upon each status change.

**Transaction History:** The app maintains a detailed history of each transaction linked to the user's ID.

## STEP 2: Overview of the Two-Balance System
## Balances:

**Grams Balance:** Holds reward grams earned for returning waste. Grams are awarded based on the weight and type of waste.

**Deposit Refund System (DRS) Balance:** This balance contains real-world funds deposited by users. DRS provides monetary value to grams and can be redeemed or withdrawn.

## Process:
**Grams and DRS Notification:** When creating a waste file, the app informs users of potential reward grams and the DRS deposit that will be held.

**Deposit Lock-In:** The deposit is held until the waste is returned and approved.

**Grams Conversion:** Upon approval, reward grams are converted into **Value Grams**.

## Using Value Grams:
Can be used in waste management educational puzzle games or transferred to DRS, with a minimum balance of 10000 grams for withdrawals.

## STEP 3: Grams Generation
## Waste Material Return Process:

**Locate a Collection Center:** Users find nearby centers or arrange a pickup.

**Weighing and Grams Approval:** Users provide product details and photos or videos of the waste on a scale. The system verifies the weight and allocates grams based on user submissions.

**Grams Allocation:** Upon approval, the calculated grams are added to the user’s **Grams balance**.

## Notification:
Users receive notifications when their waste returns are approved and grams are credited.

## STEP 4: Gamification
## Game Design:
An AI-powered puzzle game educates users on waste management.

**Challenge Mode:** Users compete in puzzle challenges, staking a portion of their grams.

**Game Levels:** The puzzle game includes increasing difficulty levels, with higher stakes at advanced levels.

## Grams Staking:
Players stake grams in challenges, with winners claiming a portion of the opponent's grams.

**In-Game Tools:** Tools can be purchased using grams to enhance gameplay.

## STEP 5: Returning Physical and Digital Disposable Waste
## Creating a Digital Waste File:

**Auto AI Input:** The app captures product details using AI from images or videos of the product label.
