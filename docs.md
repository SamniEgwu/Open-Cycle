# 1. Introduction
## Overview
The Waste Management App is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize waste disposal and recycling through technology, community involvement, and gamification. By integrating physical waste collection with digital tracking and educational gaming, the app aims to incentivize proper waste management practices and foster a sustainable community.

## Objectives
**Encourage Responsible Waste Disposal:** Incentivize users to return recyclable materials.

**Educate Users:** Provide accessible waste management education through gamified experiences.

**Foster Community Engagement:** Empower users to become active participants as collection centers, pickup agents, or transporters.

**Leverage Technology:** Utilize AI for efficient data processing and user experience enhancement.

When a new user signs up, they provide their basic information (name, email, phone number) to create an account. 

The app generates a unique App ID for each user upon successful registration. This ID is their identifier for all app transactions and activities.

## Purpose of the User ID:
**Identification:** The App ID uniquely identifies users during interactions with collection centers and pickup agents.

**Reward Grams Approval:** The ID ensures that grams earned from returning physical and digital waste are credited to the correct account.

**Tracking:** The ID allows for tracking waste materials throughout the process from collection to delivery at manufacturers or recycling companies.

## Workflow:
**Returning Waste:** Users provide their App ID and digital waste file link when dropping off waste at a collection center or handing it over to a pickup agent.

**Input Collection Center ID:** The user selects the collection center ID when making a waste return request, which the center or agent can accept or reject.

**Grams Allocation:** If the request is approved, grams listed in the digital waste file are credited to the user’s account.

**Tracking and Notifications:** The system tracks the waste lifecycle, sending notifications upon each status change.

**Transaction History:** The app maintains a detailed history of each transaction linked to the user's ID.

## STEP 2: Overview of the Two-Balance System
## Balances:

**Grams Balance:** Holds reward grams earned for returning waste. Grams are awarded based on the weight and type of waste.

**Deposit Refund System (DRS) Balance:** This balance contains real-world funds deposited by users. DRS provides monetary value to grams and can be redeemed or withdrawn.

## Process:
**Grams and DRS Notification:** When creating a waste file, the app informs users of potential reward grams and the DRS deposit that will be held.

**Deposit Lock-In:** The deposit is held until the waste is returned and approved.

**Grams Conversion:** Upon approval, reward grams are converted into **Value Grams**.

## Using Value Grams:
Can be used in waste management educational puzzle games or transferred to DRS, with a minimum balance of 10000 grams for withdrawals.

## STEP 3: Grams Generation
## Waste Material Return Process:

**Locate a Collection Center:** Users find nearby centers or arrange a pickup.

**Weighing and Grams Approval:** Users provide product details and photos or videos of the waste on a scale. The system verifies the weight and allocates grams based on user submissions.

**Grams Allocation:** Upon approval, the calculated grams are added to the user’s **Grams balance**.

## Notification:
Users receive notifications when their waste returns are approved and grams are credited.

## STEP 4: Gamification
## Game Design:
An AI-powered puzzle game educates users on waste management.

**Challenge Mode:** Users compete in puzzle challenges, staking a portion of their grams.

**Game Levels:** The puzzle game includes increasing difficulty levels, with higher stakes at advanced levels.

## Grams Staking:
Players stake grams in challenges, with winners claiming a portion of the opponent's grams.

**In-Game Tools:** Tools can be purchased using grams to enhance gameplay.

## STEP 5: Returning Physical and Digital Disposable Waste
## Creating a Digital Waste File:

**Auto AI Input:** The app captures product details using AI from images or videos of the product label.

**Manual Input:** Users can manually input product details if necessary.

**Product Details**

**Manufacturer/Brand:** Extracts the manufacturer or brand name.

**Product Name:** Identifies the product based on text and visual features.

**Packaging:** Detects the type of packaging (e.g., plastic bottle, cardboard box).

**Material Type:** Classifies the primary material (e.g., plastic, glass, metal, paper).

**Waste Classification:** Determines the waste category (e.g., recyclable, hazardous, compostable).

**What Can Be Recycled:** Lists components that can be recycled (e.g., "Bottle cap: recyclable").

**Weight:** Using the image or video seen on the scale to check if it matches 80% of other users image or video submit to the same product and the product measurement. The result of the accurate weight management of a single disposable waste product comes from the 80% human image and video submission.
Or using known packaging data or prompts the user to input the weight manually if uncertain.

**Amount:** Asks the user to provide the quantity of each product (e.g., 3 bottles of soda).

## Transferring Digital Files:
Users must provide digital waste files along with physical waste when returning waste at collection centers or to pickup agents.

## STEP 6: Creating Collection Centers and Pickup Agents
## Collection Center Setup:
Users can register locations such as depots or shops as collection centers.

Centers must input details like name, address, waste types, and business hours. A unique **Collection Center ID** is generated upon approval.

**Collection Centers Rewards:** Collection Centers earns a 10% of the approved grams rewards by them to the users.

## Becoming a Pickup Agent:
Users can apply to become pickup agents for collection centers. Agents handle nearby waste pickups and earn rewards for approved waste returns.

**Agent Rewards:** Pickup agents earn a 20% of the approved grams rewards by the them to the users.

## STEP 7: Waste Transporters
## Becoming a Waste Transporter:
Users can become waste transporters by selecting waste types to transport and specifying travel destinations.
